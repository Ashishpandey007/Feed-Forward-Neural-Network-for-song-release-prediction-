# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-for-song-release-prediction

## This assignment will familiarize you with training and evaluating feedforward neural networks. You will work on a regression task where you will have to predict the release year of a song from a set of timbre-based audio features extracted from the song. This consists of a year range between 1922 to 2011.
